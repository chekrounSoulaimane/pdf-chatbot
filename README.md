# GPT-4 & LangChain - Create a ChatGPT Chatbot for Your PDF Files

Use the new GPT-4 api to build a chatGPT chatbot for multiple Large PDF files.

Tech stack used includes LangChain, Pinecone, Typescript, Openai, and Next.js. LangChain is a framework that makes it easier to build scalable AI/LLM apps and chatbots. Pinecone is a vectorstore for storing embeddings and your PDF in text to later retrieve similar docs.

**If you run into errors, please review the troubleshooting section further down this page.**

Prelude: Please make sure you have already downloaded node on your system and the version is 18 or greater.

## Development

1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP

```
git clone [github https url]
```

2. Install packages

```
npm install
```

After installation, you should now see a `node_modules` folder.

3. Set up your `.env` file

- Copy `.env.example` into `.env`
  Your `.env` file should look like this:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=

PINECONE_API_KEY=
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=

PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=

```

- Visit [openai](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) to retrieve API keys and insert into your `.env` file.
- Visit [pinecone](https://pinecone.io/) to create and retrieve your API keys, and also retrieve your environment and index name from the dashboard.

## Convert your PDF files to embeddings

**This repo can load multiple PDF files**

1. Inside `public/docs` folder, add your pdf files or folders that contain pdf files.

2. Run the script `npm run ingest` to 'ingest' and embed your docs. If you run into errors troubleshoot below.

3. Check Pinecone dashboard to verify your vectors have been added.

## Run the app

Once you've verified that the embeddings and content have been successfully added to your Pinecone, you can run the app `npm run dev` to launch the local dev environment, and then type a question in the chat interface.
